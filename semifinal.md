### 5. **Exploratory Testing**

**Overview:**
Exploratory testing is an unscripted testing method where testers actively explore the application to discover defects that might be missed by automated or scripted testing. It relies on testers’ intuition and experience.

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility:** Allows testers to adapt their testing strategies based on real-time observations, making it ideal for uncovering complex or unexpected bugs.
- **Human Insight:** Testers can focus on the user experience and find issues that automated tests might miss, such as usability concerns.
- **Creativity:** Encourages testers to think critically and creatively, allowing them to explore paths that automated scripts wouldn’t follow.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Inconsistent Results:** As it’s unscripted, exploratory testing may produce inconsistent results depending on the tester's experience and knowledge.
- **Not Repeatable:** Unlike automated tests, exploratory tests are not repeatable, making them harder to standardize and track over time.
- **Resource-Heavy:** Requires dedicated time and skilled testers, which can be resource-intensive.
